In this project, a proxy server and client are built in Python using basic socket programming.

- The server sets up a TCP connection and waits for client requests.
- The client connects to the proxy and inputs the destination server's IP address.
- The proxy server (acting as a man-in-the-middle) receives the client's HTTP request, forwards it to the destination server, and relays the response back to the client.
- The client prints the response and calculates the round-trip time and displays the MAC address.
